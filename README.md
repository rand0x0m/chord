# chord-dfs : Minimal DFS implementing part of the Chord algorithm

## Overview

Aims to fully implement the algorithm but for the time it still lacks a lot of features other implementations have. And most notably it doesn't support fingers thus has worst time O(n) time complexity for any call. 

## Install

```
